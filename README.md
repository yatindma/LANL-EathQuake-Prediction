<i>Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.

In this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, youâ€™ll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.

If this challenge is solved and the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure.

This challenge is hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory which enhances national security by ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and global security concerns.</i>

Here in this case study we have to get the time when earthquake will occur Our goal is to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake. this experiment is performed in laboratory and data is captured

The goal of the challenge is to capture the physical state of the laboratory fault and how close it is from failure from a snapshot of the seismic data it is emitting. You will have to build a model that predicts the time remaining before failure from a chunk of seismic data, like we have done in our first paper above on easier data.

The input is a chunk of 0.0375 seconds of seismic data (ordered in time), which is recorded at 4MHz, hence 150'000 data points, and the output is time remaining until the following lab earthquake, in seconds.

The seismic data is recorded using a piezoceramic sensor, which outputs a voltage upon deformation by incoming seismic waves. The seismic data of the input is this recorded voltage, in integers.

Both the training and the testing set come from the same experiment. There is no overlap between the training and testing sets, that are contiguous in time.

Time to failure is based on a measure of fault strength (shear stress, not part of the data for the competition). When a labquake occurs this stress drops unambiguously.

The data is recorded in bins of 4096 samples. Withing those bins seismic data is recorded at 4MHz, but there is a 12 microseconds gap between each bin, an artifact of the recording device.
